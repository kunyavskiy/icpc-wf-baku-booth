# icpc-wf-baku-booth

We picked several simple problems from Astana ICPC World Finals and implemented their solutions in Kotlin, but thereâ€™s a mistake in the code. 
Your goal is to find this mistake and correct it. You should only make a small correction rather than rewrite the entire code. 

Find one mistake and correct it (each task has exactly one mistake) to get a souvenir at the booth! Correct three mistakes and you get another souvenir :)

Task 1: [Bingo for the Win!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/bingoforthewin)

Task 2: [Citizenship](https://open.kattis.com/problems/citizenship)

Task 3: [Friendly Rivalry](https://open.kattis.com/problems/friendlyrivalry)
